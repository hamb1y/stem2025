# JNVCKM Alumni Site

This is the official alumni website for JNVCKM, built with [Astro](https://astro.build), [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org), and [Netlify Identity](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/identity/).  
It’s fast, content-editable, and designed to run with **zero JavaScript for theming** and **robust, maintainable CSS**. Dynamic behavior is powered only where necessary, using Astro islands.

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Astro** – Static-first site builder with partial hydration
- **Decap CMS** – Markdown-powered, Git-based headless CMS at `/admin`
- **Netlify Identity** – Handles CMS logins and permissions
- **CSS** – Custom, semantic, themeable; no frameworks used
- **JavaScript** – Used only for dynamic components (not theming, not nav)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hamb1y/jnvckm.git
cd jnvckm

# 2. Install dependencies (pnpm preferred)
pnpm install

# 3. Start local dev server
pnpm dev
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:4321`.

## 🌐 Live Editing with Decap CMS

- Visit `/admin` in your browser
- Login using your Netlify Identity account
- Create, update, or delete content through a clean CMS UI
- Content is saved as Markdown in the repo and triggers rebuilds

---

## 🔐 Netlify Identity Access

- Only invited users can log into the CMS
- Identity roles and email invites are handled through Netlify’s dashboard
- Identity is connected to Git for commit-based CMS updates

---

## 🌗 Theme Support

- **CSS-only light/dark mode**
- Powered by the `:has()` pseudo-class on `<body>`
- No JavaScript required — instant, flicker-free theme transitions
- Logos/images can be swapped based on the active theme using pure CSS
